## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong interest in how systems work under the hood - from backend services and databases to operating systems and low-level concepts. I enjoy building maintainable, well-documented software and I'm always looking to deepen my understanding of both  theory and practice.

Most of my university work currently lives on **GitLab**, while my **personal projects are now developed on GitHub**. I'm always happy to discuss coursework or design decisions if you'd like to reach out.

I usually code in the evenings with **lo-fi or electronic music**, using **WSL + VS Code**.
